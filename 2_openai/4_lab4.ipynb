       "As of January 2026, several AI agent frameworks have emerged, each offering unique capabilities for developing intelligent systems:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Orchestral**: A lightweight Python framework providing a unified, type-safe interface for building LLM agents across major providers. It simplifies tool calling, integrates multiple LLMs, and supports advanced agent capabilities like rich tool calling and context compaction. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02577?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **AgentVNE**: A cloud-edge collaborative framework utilizing LLMs and graph reinforcement learning to address challenges in deploying multi-agent services on resource-constrained edge infrastructure. It reduces workflow communication latency and improves service acceptance rates under high-load scenarios. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02021?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Agent Lightning**: A flexible framework enabling reinforcement learning-based training of large language models for any AI agent. It decouples agent execution from training, allowing seamless integration with existing agents and supporting complex interaction logic. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03680?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **AI Agent Access (A³) Network**: An embodied, communication-aware multi-agent framework designed for 6G coverage. It integrates exploration, target user access, and backhaul maintenance within a single learning process, ensuring adaptability in dynamic environments. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18526?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Microsoft Agent Framework**: Released in public preview on October 1, 2025, this framework merges AutoGen’s dynamic multi-agent orchestration with Semantic Kernel’s production foundations. It supports both Python and .NET, delivering functional agents in under 20 lines of code, and integrates with Azure AI Foundry for cloud deployment. ([spaceo.ai](https://www.spaceo.ai/blog/agentic-ai-frameworks/?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **LangChain**: A widely adopted framework for building LLM-powered applications, emphasizing tool chaining, prompt templating, memory integration, and external API orchestration. ([agent-race.github.io](https://agent-race.github.io/AgentRace.pdf?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **MetaGPT**: A framework developed by Meta for building AI agents, focusing on modularity and scalability. ([agent-race.github.io](https://agent-race.github.io/AgentRace.pdf?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **SuperAGI**: A full-stack autonomous agent platform offering built-in telemetry, memory, vector support, an agent marketplace, and UI monitoring. It provides tools for multi-step planning and execution, suitable for end-to-end autonomous agent workflows at scale. ([apidog.com](https://apidog.com/blog/ai-agent-frameworks/?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **LiveKit**: A voice-first agent framework designed for real-time, low-latency voice pipelines. It can be used with models like Whisper and GPT, and includes built-in handling for voice activity detection, making it ideal for building voice assistants and call-based agents. ([apidog.com](https://apidog.com/blog/ai-agent-frameworks/?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Agent Zero**: A lightweight, modular logic-first stack for developers seeking modularity without opinionated tools. It serves as a blank canvas for agent logic, allowing for customized development. ([apidog.com](https://apidog.com/blog/ai-agent-frameworks/?utm_source=openai))\n",
