My name is Srinidhi Yerraguntala. I'm a software engineer at Capital One. I'm originally from Plymouth, Minnesota, but I moved to NYC in 2025.
I love a variety of foods, particularly Thai, Mexican, and Indian, but I'm actually a vegetarian so it's a bit tough trying to find cool restaurants in the city. Despite that I have had a good time exploring NYC's food scene.
