It emphasizes saving lives, preserving essential services, maintaining social cohesion, and staying as close as feasible to emissions commitments. All quantitative figures are illustrative defaults you should replace with country-specific data; I’ve included clear assumptions and ranges so you can tailor estimates quickly.\n",
       "\n",
       "Executive summary\n",
       "- Objective: minimize loss of life and economic collapse over days–weeks, weeks–months, and months–2 years; maintain social cohesion; honor emissions commitments as far as feasible.\n",
       "- Core constraints: 40% of electricity generation offline; winter demand high; limited domestic renewables; gas reserves ~2 months; underfunded grid; 20% population below poverty line.\n",
       "- Core approach: protect life and essential services first; aggressively reduce demand with targeted subsidies and efficiency; mobilize emergency generation and imports; expand low-emission capacity and efficiency in the medium term; institute robust social protection and transparent communications.\n",
       "- Key risk: inequitable access to power and fuel; policy choices that destabilize the economy or undermine emissions goals if not carefully designed. Contingency planning and ethical guardrails are integral.\n",
       "\n",
       "Important assumptions and uncertainties (use for sensitivity analysis)\n",
       "- Demand: peak national load X GW; 40% outage implies ~0.4X GW shortfall without interventions. Exact numbers depend on the country’s grid and season.\n",
       "- Gas reserves: only enough for 2 months of current gas-fired generation at current demand; international gas supply can be augmented with LNG imports.\n",
       "- Renewables: limited capacity; additive wind/solar potential small in winter; storage options limited initially.\n",
       "- Grid: distribution losses and noncritical-customer outages are high due to underinvestment; repair and maintenance cycles are disrupted.\n",
       "- Social factors: 20% below poverty line; heating needs are a major risk for mortality and morbidity during winter.\n",
       "- Emissions: strong emphasis on using gas/low-emission options first; coal or high-emission diesel would be a last resort with mitigations (emissions controls, short duration).\n",

       "\n",
       "2) Gas and fuel strategy; emissions safeguards\n",
       "- Actions:\n",
       "  - Convert to a diversified energy mix that minimizes dependence on any single fuel; preserve LNG and domestic gas reserves for critical loads; implement strict emissions controls and retirement of the most polluting options as soon as feasible.\n",
       "  - Maintain a rolling emissions trajectory that adheres to international commitments by accelerating non-emitting power and efficiency, while permitting limited, tightly controlled gas use during extreme shortages.\n",
       "- Quantified targets (illustrative):\n",
       "  - Emissions intensity of electricity generation declines year-over-year as non-emitting capacity comes online; ensure least-emitters are prioritized for critical loads during shortages.\n",

       "  - Equity considerations: prioritize low-income households and rural/remote communities that lack alternatives; ensure no disconnections for the vulnerable and critical services; maintain access to heating for those at risk of morbidity/mortality from cold.\n",
       "  Balanced against emissions commitments by:\n",
       "  - Favoring non-emitting or lowest-emitting options whenever possible for critical loads; use gas strategically only when essential; avoid coal as a default unless absolutely required for public safety and only with strict controls and rapid exit plans.\n",
       "- Practical policy rules (example):\n",
       "  - Tiered priority: (1) hospitals, water and emergency services; (2) heating for elderly, disabled, and poor households; (3) essential municipal services and critical industries; (4) remaining population with capped supply.\n",
       "  Public accountability: an independent ethical oversight panel reviews allocation decisions and risk-mitigation measures monthly.\n",
       "\n",
       "Policies to avoid (and why)\n",
       "- Across-the-board price caps that endanger utility solvency and new investment; they can lead to shortages and deterioration of service if suppliers cannot cover costs.\n",
       "- Blanket rationing that neglects vulnerability or essential services; risk of civil unrest and loss of trust.\n",
       "- Heavy-handed temporary coal usage as a default; while it may provide short-term relief, it increases emissions, undermines commitments, and may delay investment in cleaner options.\n",
       "- Expropriation of private generation without fair compensation or clear, limited-duration authority; can deter investment and create legal/financial instability.\n",
       "- Hasty rollback of essential social protections; will exacerbate poverty, hunger, and unrest.\n",
       "\n",
       "Key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics to monitor success\n",

       "- A crisis of this scale requires a carefully phased mix of protection of life and essential services, aggressive demand reduction, rapid deployment of emergency power, and a credible medium-term plan to expand low-emission capacity and energy efficiency. An ethical triage framework reduces avoidable death and hardship while preserving social cohesion and staying true to climate commitments as much as feasible.\n",
       "- If you’d like, I can tailor this to your country by plugging in your actual numbers (population, GDP, peak load, current generation mix, gas reserves, and grid specifics) and produce a concrete, device-ready plan with quantified targets, timelines, and a dashboard template."
