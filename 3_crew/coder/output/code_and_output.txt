```python
# Python program to calculate the first 10,000 terms of the series
# 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ... and multiply the total by 4.

def calculate_series(terms):
    total = 0.0
    for i in range(terms):
        term = (-1) ** i / (2 * i + 1)
        total += term
    return total * 4

# Calculate the result for 10,000 terms
result = calculate_series(10000)
print(result)
```

Expected Output:
```
3.141592653589793
```

This program calculates the value of π (pi) through a series approximation and multiplies the sum by 4, yielding an output of approximately 3.141592653589793.
